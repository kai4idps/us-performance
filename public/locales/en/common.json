While I was away, my dog somehow got into her medication and ate a whole week's worth of pills. When I got home there was vomit everywhere. I was able to check Furbo's recordings to see what time she had eaten all the pills, this information helped greatly when I called animal poison control and go to the emergency vet! So thankful for Furbo!"
